ADDED RESULT VALUE, INGREDIENTS, AND STEPS

· Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.
· Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.
· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.
· Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.
· Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.
· Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.
· Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.

What Is Tres Leches?
A tres leches cake is a sponge cake that is soaked in three kinds of milk. Though the cake is saturated in liquid, it's not dense — tres leches is known for its light and fluffy texture.

How to Make Tres Leches Cake
1. Make the cake: Sift the dry ingredients together in a bowl, then beat the butter and sugar together in another bowl. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Pour the batter into a prepared pan, then bake until a toothpick comes out clean. Pierce the cake all over.
2. Soak in milk: Mix the three milks together in a bowl. Pour the mixture over the cooled sponge cake.
3. Top with whipped cream: Beat the whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Spread over the cake.

Ingredients
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

½ cup unsalted butter

1 cup white sugar

5 eggs

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

2 cups whole milk

1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk

1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream

1 cup white sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.

Sift flour and baking powder together; set aside.

Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Add flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until well blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Pierce cake all over with a fork; let cool to room temperature.

Mix whole milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk together in a bowl; pour over the top of the cooled cake and allow to soak in.

Whip cream, remaining 1 cup of sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until thick. Spread over the top of the filling. Keep cake refrigerated until serving.
