    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Step 1</b>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Step 2</b>Sift flour and baking powder together; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Step 3</b>
            Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Add flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until well blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan.

            Whip cream, remaining 1 cup of sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until thick. Spread over the top of the filling. Keep cake refrigerated until serving.
